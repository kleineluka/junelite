- You may not edit the code in redistributions or redistribute the code alone.
- You may not take the code for your own projects (ex. copy and pasting it without modifications).
- You may edit the code for personal use. (i'm not your mother!!)
- You may (and are encouraged to) learn from the code, and take those techniques with you on your own adventures (ex. seeing how to transform an rgb colour to monochrome)!
- You are free to make pull requests of course, I love learning about ways to improve my code!
- You may redistribute the shader in transformative works (commercial or free) with proper attribution. Examples of transformative works are (but not limited to) an animation for an avatar, a world, a video, or a game.
- As long as it is not any case stated above, assume MIT for now. This may change at any time!
For any questions, pleaes contact me with the details on my Github profile!
