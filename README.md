# 💎 Why use June Lite?
- You can make your own transformative works (avatars, worlds) and **resell** them with the shader included!
- Sometimes you don’t need a full-stack of effects and just need a few effects. June Lite excels here because it is super fast and small!
- June Lite is easy as!
- It’s perfect for new creators, and it even has an “advice” tab for tutorials information~
- It's perfect for experienced creators as it's packed with more advanced features as well (ex. Fog Safespaces and Animated Overlays).
- It is a good resource for those who want to learn about shader development or see how post-processing effects work (a lot of these calculations are standard even in software like image editors)

# ⭐ What can I use it for?
- Unity games
- Avatar effects and gimmicks
- Interactive worlds
- Work showcase
- ... and anything you want! (like really, a lot more)

# 😵‍💫 How do I use it?
- Download the zip, extract it, and drop it into Unity.
- Make a material, and make a cube and drag it onto it. Done! Now customize as you want.

# 📝 What is the license? 
- You may not edit the code in redistributions or redistribute the code alone.
- You may not take the code for your own projects (ex. copy and pasting it without modifications).
- You may edit the code for personal use. (i'm not your mother!!)
- You may (and are encouraged to) learn from the code, and take those techniques with you on your own adventures (ex. seeing how to transform an rgb colour to monochrome)!
- You are free to make pull requests of course, I love learning about ways to improve my code!
- You may redistribute the shader in transformative works (commercial or free) with proper attribution. Examples of transformative works are (but not limited to) an animation for an avatar, a world, a video, or a game.

For any questions, pleaes contact me with the details on my Github profile!
