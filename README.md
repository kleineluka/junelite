# 🍩 Download? Here!
Yes, everyone just wants this. Please download the latest ready-to-use UnityPackage from my [Gumroad](http://www.luka.moe/go/gumroad) or [Booth](http://www.luka.moe/go/booth) (don't forget to give a rating or favorite!).

# 🍡 About
June Lite is a free version of my post-procesisng shader “June” for Unity and VRChat. It includes a myriad of screen effects (think shakes, blurs, image filters, etc.) that you can apply to your VRChat avatar, VRChat world, Unity projects, and Unity games! If you are interested in the paid version, more information will follow at the bottom. In one short description: it makes your projects prettier!

# 🥺 What’s in June Lite?
- Custom, fast and easy UI!
- Multilingual editor (currently supporting: English, Deutsch, and 日本)
- Smooth distance-based falloff and UV out-of-bounds cleaning
- Gaussian Blur, Radial Blur, Chromatic Aberration
- Horizontal and Vertical Borders
- Colour Manipulation (colour grading, rgb and hsv controls, greyscale, invert, and posterization)
- Distortion (sin cos, wavey, texture, wobble)
- Filters (vignette, colour crush, duotone, rainbow, film, grain, vhs, gradient, outline, astral, neon)
- Fog (including a safespace area)
- Glitch (uvs and chromatic)
- Image Overlay (still and animated)
- UV Manipulation (transformation, movement, shake, pixelation, rotation, spherize)
- Zoom

# 💎 Why use June Lite?
- It has a lot less effects, scripts, options, and styles in trade for a free experience and a [permissable license](https://github.com/kleineluka/junelite?tab=readme-ov-file#what-is-the-license).
- You can make your own transformative works (avatars, worlds) and **resell** them with the shader included!
- Sometimes you don’t need a full-stack of effects and just need a few effects. June Lite excels here because it is super fast and small!
- Post-processing stacks, whether Unity or the [full version of June](http://www.luka.moe/june), can be complex and overwhelming. June Lite is easy as!
- It’s perfect for new creators, and it even has an “advice” tab for tutorials information~
- It's perfect for experienced creators as it's packed with more advanced features as well (ex. Fog Safespaces and Animated Overlays).
- It is a good resource for those who want to learn about shader development or see how post-processing effects work (a lot of these calculations are standard even in software like image editors)
- You can have a “trial” of my work and June before purchasing the paid version. (if that so interests you..)

# ⭐ What can I use it for?
- Unity games
- Avatar effects and gimmicks
- Interactive worlds
- Work showcase
- ... and anything you want! (like really, a lot more)

# 😵‍💫 How do I use it?
- Download the zip (Booth) or unitypackage (Gumroad), and drag and drop it into Unity.
- Make a material, and make a cube and drag it onto it. Done! Now customize as you want.

# 📝 What is the license? 
- You may not edit the code in redistributions or redistribute the code alone.
- You may not take the code for your own projects (ex. copy and pasting it without modifications).
- You may edit the code for personal use. (i'm not your mother!!)
- You may (and are encouraged to) learn from the code, and take those techniques with you on your own adventures (ex. seeing how to transform an rgb colour to monochrome)!
- You may redistribute the shader in transformative works (commercial or free) with proper attribution Examples of transformative works are (but not limited to) an animation for an avatar, a world, a video, or a game.
For any questions, pleaes contact me with the details on my Github profile!

# 🦄 And what about the paid version?
- A loooot more effects, optimized shader locking, a feature-packed UI..
- Scripts to help you in Unity, AudioLink, and so so much more!
- You can find more info out on [my website](http://www.luka.moe/june), [my Booth](http://www.luka.moe.go/booth) and [my Gumroad](http://www.luka.moe/go/gumroad)~

# 👽 And can I compile it myself?!
- Shaders don't need compiled! Just drag it into Unity.
- However, the Github doesn't have the images for the UI editor.
- You will need to get the images from the Booth/Gumroad package, or you will need to edit the editor file (.cs) to not require image resources. (note: the shader will work fine, the editor just will error without)
