## Version 3.0 (August 2025)
- Brand new UI! Much easier and more intuitive to use.
- Many more languages added to the user interface!
- A cleaner, more permissive and easier to understand license.
- Fixed issue where "Glitch" would shift the whole screen over and/or make the whole screen display chromatic aberration.
- Made "Duotone" have colours set by default for a better example of what it does.
- Made "HSV" in "Colouring" have default values as well, so it doesn't look broken when first applied.
- Added "Dithering" option to all three "Blur" styles, which helps create a higher quality blur effect with less performance cost. It won't be used if the dither value is set to 0.
- Renamed "Astral" to "Astral Projection" to better reflect what it does.
- Added "Blend Mode" to "Overlay"
- Added "Overlay VR Settings" to the "Overlay" section, which allows you to set the size and offset of the overlay in VR specifically (to compensate for the different pov/aspect ratio).

- Added "Rainbow" to "Colouring" (moved from "Filter")
